            <p class="section-copy">While we work hard to place animals as quickly as possible in order to rescue more,
                we are committed to making great matches. Our open, friendly, and conversation-based process considers
                many factors – energy level, personality, and experience, to name a few – when making a match. If the
                animal’s needs are met and you are happy with the pet you bring home, it is more likely to last forever.
                We look forward to helping you meet your new best friend!</p>
